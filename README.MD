# A Comprehensive Security Vulnerability Assessment Framework
## Overview
This project provides a structured framework for demonstrating and analyzing security vulnerabilities in the Texter chat application. Through carefully crafted testing scenarios and proof-of-concept implementations, we showcase various security weaknesses and their potential impact on system integrity.
Project Purpose
The primary objectives of this security testing framework are to:

Demonstrate real-world security vulnerabilities in chat applications
Provide educational insights into web application security
Document attack vectors and their implications
Showcase the importance of proper security implementations

# Attack Scenarios
This framework includes demonstrations of several critical vulnerabilities:

### Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Attacks

Credential harvesting through form injection
Data exfiltration using webhooks
Session hijacking demonstrations


### Rate Limiting Vulnerabilities

HTTP request flooding
WebSocket connection flooding
Server resource exhaustion testing


### Authentication Weaknesses

GitHub token extraction
Session management flaws
Authentication bypass attempts
